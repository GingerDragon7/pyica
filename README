A python package for Independent Component Analysis (ICA).  Currently, only fixed-point FastICA is supported.  
Calculations can be performed in either python (using numpy/scipy) or in R's 'fastICA' package, if rpy2, R,
and the 'fastICA' package are installed on your system.

See the documentation in the modules for detailed usage.  If you have a data matrix of N mixtures and T 
samples, basic usage to extract n <= N sources amounts to:

	import fastica as ica
	A,W,S = ica.fastica(X,n)

for the python version and

	import rpyica as ica
	A,W,S = rpyica.fastica_rpy(X,n)

for the version that connects to R.
