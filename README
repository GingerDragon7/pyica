A python package for Independent Component Analysis (ICA).  Currently, only fixed-point FastICA is supported.  
Calculations can be performed in either python (using numpy/scipy) or in R's 'fastICA' package, if rpy2, R,
and the 'fastICA' package are installed on your system.

See the documentation in the modules for detailed usage and function arguments.  Assuming you've cloned into 
a location python knows about and you want to extract n <= N sources from a data matrix X of size N x T, 
you can do

	import pyica.fastica as ica
	A,W,S = ica.fastica(X,n)

for the python version and

	import pyica.rpyica as ica
	A,W,S = ica.fastica_rpy(X,n)

for the version that connects to R.

All source code is made available under the BSD-3 license.

There is currently minimal testing code in the tests/ directory; the tests use pytest, which you will have to 
install if you do not have it.  If you do have it, run

	>py.test -v test_ica_pytest.py

There is an issue in comparing the results from python to those from R.  It turns out (at least on 
my system) that python and R treat "junk" singular values differently.  Hence, if you vastly overextract 
(asking for, say, 60 sources when there are only 10 true ones in X) you will see different results with
the pure python and R versions of fastICA, even with all other parameters being equal.  This should not
cause a problem, and does not show up unless you ask for vastly more sources than are actually present
in the data.
